A1LV7MYZURBMJ2,CUISINART I THOUGHT BUILT QUALITY PRODUCTS THEN THEY STARTED MANUFACTURING THIS MESS THAT THEY CALL A BLENDER WHAT A STRETCH TO CALL IT A BLENDER IT NEEDS HELP TO PUREE THE INGREDIENTS FOR A SMOOTHIE YOU MUST FREQUENTLY STIR THE INGREDIENTS YOURSELF THE BLADE ASSEMBLY EVENTUALLY CRACKED THERE IS NOW A BLACK RESIDUE AROUND THE BLACK WHIRLY THING ON THE BASE MY HUSBAND THINKS THAT IT OVER HEATED ALL THAT DAMAGE FROM MAKING SMOOTHIES YEP CUISINART TAKE NOTEI AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS OTHERS FEEL THE SAME IM HAPPY THAT SOME FOLKS HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BLENDER BUT I AM NOT ONE OF THEM,NOTPERFECT

A19FRW264WZTGP,IN MY HUMBLE OPINION MOST OF BLENDERS ARE NOT GREAT THE MOTORS ARE NOT POWERFUL TO CHOP THROUGH HEAVY AMOUNTS ICE AND FROZEN FRUIT IVE BURNED THROUGH A COUPLE OF CHEAP HAMILTON BEACH ONES SO IF YOU ARE DOING A LOT OF ENTERTAINING YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT A COMMERCIAL ONEUSE YOUR HEAD YOU MAY NEED TO PULSE IT A FEW TIME TO SHAVE THE FROZEN STUFF DOWN OR YOU CAN SLOWLY ADD ICE AFTER YOU BLENDED THE OTHER IGREDIENTS ALSO YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE RECIPE BOOK THE RECIPE BOOK GIVES YOU HINTS ON HOW TO LAYER THE INGREDIENTSI MADE SOME AWESOME HUMMUS BY FOLLOWING THEIR DIRECTIONSAS I SAID EARLIER IF YOU ARE DOING HEAVY BLENDING WORK WITH ICE YOU MAY NEED A PROFESSIONAL UNIT I HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE HIGH END WARINGS FIT THE BILL,NOTPERFECT

A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,COMPARISONCUISINART AUTOMATIC QTTHE RIVAL GEL CANISTER AND THERIVAL ELECTRIC QT ICEI HAVE HAD QUITE THE EXPERIENCE WITH ICE CREAM MAKERS LATELY AND AM HAPPY TO PASS ON MY OWN COMPARISONI ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE RIVAL ELECTRIC QT ICE ON A WHIM WHEN I PASSED BY IT IN THE STORE THIS IS THE SAME ONE AS THE QT ICE CREAM MAKER THAT USES ROCK SALT AND ICE JUST LARGER I KNOW ITS THE SAME BECAUSE THE INLAWS HAVE THE QT IT WAS ON SALE AT WALMART AND EVEN CHEAPER THAN AMAZONI THEN EXCHANGED THE ABOVE ICE CREAM MAKER AFTER ISSUES I WILL GET TO FOR THE RIVAL GELYOULL NOTICE HOWEVER I HAVE THE VERIFIED PURCHASE STAMP ON MY REVIEW OF THE CUISINART QT AUTOMATIC ICE CREAM MAKER THATS BECAUSE I GAVE UP WITH RIVAL AFTER CONTINUED PROBLEMS WITH MY FIRST TWO ICE CREAM MAKERS AND ORDERED THE CUISINART FROM AMAZON ITS A KEEPER HOWEVER YOU MAY ACTUALLY PREFER ONE OF THE OTHER ONES I USED MORE IF YOUR NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT FROM MY OWN SO ILL BREAK DOWN MY EXPERIENCES AND YOU CAN DECIDEBUT FIRSTSOME TROUBLESHOOTING THAT MAY HELP YOU REGARDLESS OF THE ICE CREAM MAKER YOU CHOOSE IS YOUR ICECREAM MORE OF A MILKSHAKE THAN ICE CREAM I HAVE SOME CHEF TIPSNEVER PUT IN CHUNKY INGREDIENTS FROM THE BEGINNING THEY DONT ALLOW THE BUTTERFAT TO FREEZE CORRECTLY THEY NEED TO BE ADDED AT THE END CHOCOLATE CHIPS FRUIT ETCSOY MILK NO PROBLEMNEVER USE IMITATION VANILLA EXTRACT IT CONTAINS PROPYLENE GLYCOL WHICH NOT ONLY ISNT AS GOOD AS REGULAR VANILLA IT PREVENTS MILK AND CREAM FROM FREEZING WELL USE PURE VANILLA ONLYYOUR INGREDIENTS SHOULD BE COLD PRIOR TO ADDING THEM TO THE ICE CREAM MAKERIF YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC ICE CREAM MAKER IT NEEDS TO BE ON AND SPINNING PRIOR TO PUTTING THE INGREDIENTS IN IF YOU ADD THE INGREDIENTS FIRST AND THEN TURN IT ON THE EDGES WILL FREEZE FIRST TO THE BOWL AND YOUR MIDDLE WONT CATCH UP UNFORTUNATELY YOU CANT DO THIS ON THE RIVAL AND QT ELECTRIC SO IT ALWAYS WOUND UP A LITTLE RUNNY FOR MEIF YOU USE AN ELECTRIC GELBOWL ICE CREAM MAKER THE BOWL SHOULD BE STORED AT THE BACK OF YOUR FREEZER WHERE IT IS COLDEST IF YOUR FREEZER IS FULL OF OTHER FOODS IT WILL ACTUALLY BE COLDER THAN IF IT IS EMPTY SO AN EMPTY FREEZER MAY MEAN YOU NEED TO FREEZE YOUR GELFILLED ICE CREAM BOWL LONGERCREAM HAS A HIGHER BUTTERFAT CONTENT THAN MILK SO IT BEGINS TO MELT FAR FASTER AND WILL TAKE LONGER TO FREEZE SO YOU WILL SEE DIFFERENCES FROM SOY MILK MILK NONFAT MILK ETCICE CREAM CAPACITYRIVAL ELECTRIC RE OR QTS DEPENDING UPON WHICH MODEL YOU CHOOSERIVAL GEL RG ONE QUARTCUISINART AUTOMATIC CA QTSNOISE LEVELRE LOUD CANNOT HOLD A CONVERSATION IN THE SAME ROOM ITS INRG LOUD CANNOT HOLD A CONVESATION IN THE SAME ROOM ITS INCA SURPRISINGLY QUIETNOT SILENT BUT QUITE A PURR COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWOBUILDRE CHEAPLY MADE WHICH WOUND UP BEING OUR PROBLEM THE OUTSIDE CORE IS A VERY FLIMSY PLASTIC THINNER THAN MY TUPPERWARE NOT ONLY DID THIS NOT INSULATE THE ICE WELL WHICH RESULTED IN FAST MELTING IT ALSO WORE DOWN AFTER A WEEK OF THE MOTOR POPPING OUT OF THE LOCKED POSITION AND ITS FLEXIBILITY ALLOWED PIECES OF ICE TO GET LODGED IN THE SIDES AND MAKE THE MOTOR STOP THIS IS SO COMMON THAT IT SAYS IN THE OWNERS MANUAL THAT WHEN IT DOES THIS YOU NEED TO STOP IT AND MOVE THE ICE THIS MEANS YOU ALWAYS NEED TO BE WATCHING IT DURING MAKING HAPPENS ON BOTH SIZE MODELS WHICH IS WHY I HAD TO EXCHANGE THIS ORIGINALLY FOR THE GEL MODEL AT WALMART THAT FLIMSY PLASTIC WORE DOWN AFTER JUST ONE WEEK FROM THE MOTOR POPPING OFF OF THE LOCK SOCKETSRG MADE BETTER THAN THE OTHER MODEL EXCEPT THE TOP LEAVES AIR IN TOO CLOSE TO ICE CREAM WHICH MEANS IT DOESNT FREEZE AS WELL AND THE FILL HOLE IS ON AN ANGLE RATHER THAN TOP AND IS VERY SMALL SO INGREDIENTS SPILL EASILYCA I LIKE THE MAKE COMPACT SO NO WARM AIR IS INSIDE STURDY STORES MORE EASILY WITH CORD COMPARTMENT HEAVYDUTY WITH NO FLIMSINESS OR EASILY BROKEN PARTSCONCEPTRE WINDS UP COSTING MORE DUE TO NEEDING TO BUY ROCK SALT AND CRUSHED ICE EACH TIME THE MANUAL STATES TO USE CRUSHED ICE ONLY AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE TOP POPS OFF EASILY AND ICE CAN GET LODGED BETWEEN SPINNING BOWL AND THE SIDE FOR SOME CRAZY REASON THE PADDLE DOESNT SPIN THE BOWL DOES WHICH MEANS IT MAKES THE ICE MIGRATE AND MELT EASILY ROCK SALT SHOULD NOT GO DOWN YOUR SINK SO WE WOULD ALSO WALK IT OUTSIDE TO THE STREET YOU DONT WANT IT IN YOUR YARD EITHER VERY MESSY WITH ALL THE ROCK SALT AND ICE BEING POURED IN WHILE RUNNING IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER TWO MODELSRG FREEZE THE GEL BOWL FOR ABOUT HOURS AND USE NO ROCK SALT OR ICECA SAME AS THE RGISSUESRE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH HAVING TO FOOL WITH IT DURING THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY EVEN IF THE ICECREAM IS RUNNY WHEN IT SENSES THE EDGES ARE DONERG MOTOR OVERHEATS EASILY AND WHEN IT DOES THIS IT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY AND WONT ALLOW YOU TO START IT AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MINUTES AN ICE CREAM MAKER ISNT NEEDED TO MIX INGREDIENTS BUT TO WHIP AIR INTO IT SO IT DOESNT FREEZE AS AN ICE BLOCK BUT INSTEAD BECOMES FLUFFY THIS MEANS YOU RUIN YOUR MIX AND HAVE TO START OVER THEY NEED A MORE POWERFUL MOTOR TO AVOID THIS RATHER THAN AN AUTO SHUT OFF WHICH RUINS YOUR BATCHCA DOES NOT TURN OFF AUTOMATICALLY AND HAS NEVER OVERHEATED IF YOU NEED MORE FREEZING TIME YOU CAN JUST KEEP ON GOING I HAVENT YET HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY CUISINART BUT WILL REPORT BACK IF ONE COMES UPTIME NEEDED TO WORKRE USUALLY MINRG USUALLY TO MINCA USUALLY TO MINTHE TIME WILL VARY PER INGREDIENTS I BASED THE ABOVE ALL ON MY PLAIN VANILLA RECIPEALL MODELS COME WITH A BASIC RECIPE BOOK BUT THEY ARE SO BASIC YOULL PROBABLY WANT A GOOD ICE CREAM RECIPE BOOK I LOVE THE BEN AND JERRYS ONE BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST RECIPES BUT GOES INTO THE SCIENCE OF MAKING THE PERFECT BOWL TOO THE CUISINART HAS THE NUTRITIONALS TO EVERY RECIPE THE RIVAL DOESNT YOU PROBABLY DONT WANT TO SEE THE CALORIES OF ICE CREAM ANYWAY ESPECIALLY CHOCOLATEWARRANTYRE YEARRG YEARCA YEARSICE CREAM CONSISTENCYRE I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RIVAL ELECTRIC IT RUNS UNTIL IT SENSES THE OUTSIDE EDGES ARE DONE BUT THIS LEFT MY INSIDE ICE CREAM EDGES NOT WHIPPED IT SAYS TO GET IT HARD YOU SHOULD FREEZE IT FOR HOURS BUT THE NEXT DAY SINCE AIR WASNT WHIPPED IN IT LEFT IT A BLOCK OF ICE AND I COULDNT EVEN SCOOP IT BECAUSE OF THIS AND THEN THE PLASTIC LOCK IN WEARING OUT IS WHY I RETURNED IT FOR THE RIVAL GELRG I GOT A GOOD BATCH BUT IT WAS STILL SOFTER THAN I WANTED HOWEVER THE NEXT TIMES THE MOTOR GOT HOT AND AS PER THE OWNERS MANUAL APPARENTLY THIS DESIGN FLAW IS COMMON ENOUGH THAT IT TURNS ITSELF OFF WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND WONT START AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MIN LEAVING ME WITH BAD BATCHES SO I RETURNED ITCA IF YOU LIKE YOURS SOFT MIN SEEMS TO WORK WELL FOR THAT BUT I USUALLY GO ALL THE WAY TO MIN TO GET THE PERFECT CONSISTENCY OF WHIPPED AIR INTO THE ICECREAM ALLOWING IT TO BE SOFT BUT STILL EASILY SCOOPED DAYS LATER EVEN ON HIGH BUTTERFAT ICE CREAM RECIPES WE HAD A PERFECT CONSISTENCY SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS ONE THAT WAS THE MAIN THING FOR ME TO GET A GOOD WHIPPED UP ICE CREAM NOT AN ICY ONE EVEN DAYS LATER THIS ONE IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A HEAVY DUTY MOTOR WHICH MAY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE IN IT NOT OVERHEATINGCLEANING OWNERS MANUAL OF ALL SAY TO CLEAN PARTS IN WARM SOAPY WATER NOT THE DISHWASHERCONCLUSION ALTHOUGH THE RIVAL ELECTRIC HOLDS MORE ICE CREAM WHICH IS PERFECT IF YOU ARE MAKING IT FOR A BIG CROWD I HAVE HAD NO NEGATIVE RESULTS WITH THE CUISINART SINCE I ORDERED IT WHILE THE OTHER MAKERS WERE RETURNED TO THE STOREAND I RARELY RETURN ANYTHING HOWEVER ITS ALSO POSSIBLE I JUST GOT UNLUCKY SO IF YOU WANT A LARGE CAPACITY AND HAVE EASIER ACCESS THAN I DO TO CRUSHED ICE IT MIGHT BE WORTH A TRYFOR ME THE CUSINART QT IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO KEEP THE ICE CREAM FRESH FOR US BEFORE ITS TIME TO MAKE ANOTHER BATCH FOR A LARGE FAMILY IT MAY NOT WORK BUT WE NIBBLE ON IT FOR A WEEK THEN MAKE ANOTHER BATCH AND THAT WORKS GREAT FOR US AND SINCE THE CONSISTENCY AND MOTOR WHERE BETTER THAN THE RIVAL GEL FOR ME THIS REMAINS MY PICK,PERFECT

WARRANTY ON DEFECTS NOT A SHABBY DEAL IN THE LEASTEACH PIECE IS WRAPPED CAREFULLY IN PLASTIC BAGS WHICH I SUGGEST SAVING TOO THE LARGER ONES AT LEAST USE THESE TO WRAP THE FREEZER BOWL WHILE PREPARING IT FOR USE MORE ON THAT TO COMESO NOW YOUVE UNPACKED IT WHAT TO DO WITH AN ICE CREAM MAKER YOU JUST UNWRAPPED ONE MIGHT LIKE TO RIP RIGHT IN TO MAKING ICE CREAM BUT THAT CANT HAPPEN WITH THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE IT DOES NOT OFFER A COMPRESSOR IN ORDER TO CHILL THE PRODUCT AS YOU GO YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE COLD AND THAT MEANS CLEANING OUT A SPACE IN THE FREEZER AND MAKE IT A PERMANENTLYCLEARED SPACE CAUSE YOULL NEED IT TRUST MEYOULL WANT TO WASH THE FREEZER BOWL FIRST IN THE SINK ONLY NO DISHWASHER NO ABRASIVESNO CLEANSERS WARM WATER AND LIQUID SOAP WITH A SOFT CLOTH AND
